# shopify-autoaccounting ðŸ¤‘
Application that automatically stores shopify orders and build a fully fledged financial statement in Google Sheets

I'm using Shopify API to get order infomations from the client and pushing the datas in a brand new Google Sheet.
For prototyping, i'm using vanilla JS & NodeJS. If everythings works fine i will then move to React.
